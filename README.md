Quoting: 
> There are plenty of materials and training options out there for AI, machine learning and deep learning, everything from e-books and blogs, through online tutorials and MooCs, to the formal courses offered by universities and corporations.
> Some of these are excellent, and they each have their place. The challenge is knowing where to start and having the time to research and study what you need to know...
>
> **As a specialist provider of technical training, Doulos has been able to condense the essential knowledge and skills you need to get started with AI at the edge and deep learning into practical training courses within the space of a week.**
